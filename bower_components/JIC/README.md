# J I C 
**J I C** is a Javascript Image Compressor using HTML5 Canvas & File API that allows you to compress your jpeg & png images before uploading to the server (100% client-side and no extra libraries requried!)

Could you imagine how much bandwidth we can save if Google, Twitter and r Facebook implement this image compression before we upload those 5MB photos? This approach will make the internet faster!!

You can check the working demo here : http://makeitsolutions.com/labs/jic/

## Requirements or Dependencies

- NONE

## Install via Bower

```sh
bower install JIC
```

## How it works

To compress the image, first it converts an image object to canvas and then compress it with the canvas method **toDataURL(mimetype, quality)**

Then to upload the image object it uses the XMLHTTPRequest method sendAsBinary and sends the data url of the compressed image to the server and that's all!! Easy huh? 


## Example

**J I C** has only 2 methods: compress & upload. Check it out:

```javascript

//========= Step 1 - Client Side Compression ===========

//Images Objects
var source_img = document.getElementById("source_img"),
    target_img = document.getElementById("target_img");

//(NOTE: see the examples/js/demo.js file to understand how this object could be a local image 
//from your filesystem using the File API)

//An Integer from 0 to 100
var quality =  80,
// output file format (jpg || png)
output_format = 'jpg', 
//This function returns an Image Object 
target_img.src = jic.compress(source_img,quality,output_format).src;  


//======= Step 2 - Upload compressed image to server =========

//Here we set the params like endpoint, var name (server side) and filename
var server_endpoint = 'upload.php',
	server_var_name = 'file',
	filename = "new.jpg";

//This is the callback that will be triggered once the upload is completed
var callback = function(response){ console.log(response); }

//Here goes the magic
jic.upload(target_img, server_endpoint, server_var_name, filename, callback);

//=======  Optional parameters example: errorCallback, duringCallback and customHeaders ======= 
// This function gets called on an error response of the server - status code of >= 400.
var errorCallback = function () {
	// Handle upload failure
};

// This function gets called while the file is uploading. Returns the percent completeness of the image being uploaded
var duringCallback = function (progressPercent) {
	//progressPercent can be used to show a progress bar
};

// Custom Request Headers, nifty for things like Basic Authorization

var customHeaders = { 'Authorization': 'Basic someBase64EncodedHash=====' };

jic.upload(target_img, server_endpoint, server_var_name, filename, successCallback, errorCallback, duringCallback, customHeaders);


```
